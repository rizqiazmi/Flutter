# Flutter
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit (SDK) created by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop platforms from a single codebase. With Flutter, developers can use a reactive programming model to create highly customized and visually appealing user interfaces using a wide range of customizable widgets.

Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is also developed by Google, and provides a rich set of tools and features to enable rapid development and testing. It includes a hot reload feature, which allows developers to make changes to their code and see the results immediately without having to restart the application.

Flutter has gained popularity among developers because of its ability to create beautiful and performant applications across multiple platforms with a single codebase, reducing development time and costs.
